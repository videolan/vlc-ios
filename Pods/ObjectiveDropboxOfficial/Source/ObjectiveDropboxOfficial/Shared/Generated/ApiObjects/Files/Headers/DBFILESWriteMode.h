/// The `WriteMode` union.
///
/// Your intent when writing a file to some path. This is used to determine what
/// constitutes a conflict and what the autorename strategy is. In some
/// situations, the conflict behavior is identical: (a) If the target path
/// doesn't refer to anything, the file is always written; no conflict. (b) If
/// the target path refers to a folder, it's always a conflict. (c) If the
/// target path refers to a file with identical contents, nothing gets written;
/// no conflict. The conflict checking differs in the case where there's a file
/// at the target path with contents different from the contents you're trying
/// to write.
///
/// This class implements the `DBSerializable` protocol (serialize and
/// deserialize instance methods), which is required for all Obj-C SDK API route
