Annoucement: There's a new OneDrive SDK
================

The Live SDK has been replaced by the [OneDrive API](https://dev.onedrive.com) and 
[OneDrive SDK for iOS](https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-sdk-ios). All new projects
should use the OneDrive API to integrate with OneDrive instead of Live SDK.

This Live SDK project will remain available for existing applications to continue to use
but new application development should be done using the OneDrive SDK.


Live SDK for iOS (legacy)
================

version 5.6


1. Introduction
---------------

For integrating OneDrive into your iOS app use the [OneDrive iOS SDK](http://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-sdk-ios).

The repository here includes:
- Live SDK Library source (src/LiveSDK/Library)
- Live SDK framework (bin/LiveSDK.framework.zip)
- Samples (src/samples)

For questions on how to use the sdk visit http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/onedrive

2. Reference the API
--------------------

You can reference the iOS API in two ways.

###2.1 Install with Cocoapods

* [Install cocoapods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) following the getting started guide.
* Add the following to your Podfile: `pod 'LiveSDK'`
* Run the command `pod install` to install the latest LiveSDK pod.

###2.2 To reference the iOS API source code directly

* Open your iOS project in Xcode.
* Click File > Add Files to "Your Project Name".
* Go to and select the src/LiveSDK/Library folder under your local copy of the repository and then click "Add".
* In your code file that you want to reference the API source code, add this import statement: `#import "LiveConnectClient.h"`.

#####Notes:
If you reference the iOS API source code directly and you use Xcode 4.2 or later, you must disable Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). This is because the Live SDK for iOS library source code uses manual reference counting. If you want to use ARC, you can either reference the iOS API framework by following the steps in the previous section(see 2.1), or do an ARC conversion on the library source code.
